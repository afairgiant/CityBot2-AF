<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
CityBot2 is a Python-based app designed to create social media postings for a local area, with the initial version featuring news source RSS feeds and government-sourced data on weather, and earthquakes. It supports postings to Bluesky, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter/X.

You can download it to your server and schedule it to run with customizations for your city. I'd love your help testing and improving!

This is a major upgrade and full rewrite of my original (archived) [CityBot](https://github.com/ericrosenberg1/CityBot).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This app comes with no warranties or guarantees. Use it at your own risk. I suggest a using virtual environment to segregate the files and dependencies from the rest of your system. If you don't know what that means, you should probably do some more tinkering and come back when you're ready to roll.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the latest version of Python and setup a VENV where you can install dependencies. You'll also likely want an updated version of PIP.

How to update Python: [How to Update Python](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-update-python/).

I suggest creating a new directory where you want to store the project, create a VENV there, and ensure pip is updated in that VENV.
   ```sh
 mkdir CityBot2
 python3 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate
 pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

### Installation

To install CityBot2, you can clone the respository to your system and run the installer. It's reccomended you run this in a virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository to your desired directory. I used /code/CityBot2.

Example:
'''sh
git clone https://github.com/ericrosenberg1/CityBot2
'''

2. Run the installer
'''sh
chmod +x install.sh  #Ensure correct permissions for installer script
./install.sh         #Run installer script
'''

3. Edit configuration files:
Navigate to the config directory. Using the nano editor, add your social network credentials.
''sh
cd config
mv credentials.env.example credentials.env
nano credentials.env
'''
Press CTRL+X and enter Y at the prompt to save and exit.

Then update your social_config file with details for your city. Remove the example settings from Ventura, California.
'''
nano config/social_config.json
'''
Press CTRL+X and enter Y at the prompt to save and exit.

4. Start the service:
   - `sudo systemctl start citybot`

5. Enable service at boot:
   - `sudo systemctl enable citybot`

6. Check service status:
   - `sudo systemctl status citybot`

7. View logs:
   - `tail -f logs/citybot.log`

## Dependencies

CityBot2 requires the following dependencies:
- python3-pip
- python3-dev
- build-essential
- libatlas-base-dev
- gfortran
- libgeos-dev
- libproj-dev
- proj-data
- proj-bin

## Usage
After updating the config files, you can run the bot and it should automatically post to your desired social media accounts. Check the error log if something isn't working.
